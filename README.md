# hAKathon - The Alaska Hackathon Project

## News

The Alaska Hackathon Project (hAKathon) is currently raising funds for version 2017.01 and we are seeking financial and volunteer supporters! Contact alaskahackathon@gmail.com for more info.

## Hack-a-who?

Are you a non-profit, government, or private organization looking to solve a data problem? Have a bunch of data, but not sure what to do with it? This event is for you.

## Hack-a-what?

Mounds of data, amazing insight locked away in disparate data, an answer looking for its problem, a problem looking for a solution.

Non-profit and government organizations through Alaska are looking for ways to utilize their data in a different way! Some may have a problem they are looking to solve, while others have large amounts of data, but want a way to utilize it.

## Hack-a-why?

Because we can...

Hacking within a community helps projects and people succeed and in turn we are helping our community succeed. Many great projects don't have the resources for a dedicated development team, but we have many talented developers willing to give their time to make our home a better place through better use of data.

Why the heck not...

## Hack-a-where?

To be determined for 2017.01 - Previous locations have involved the Anchorage MakerSpace and The Boardroom.

## Hack-a-when?
